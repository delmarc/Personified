Personified
===========

Someone where I work was like it was wasteful to do a proprietary MVC codebase... Its like come on guys... I thought what we do was supposed to be fun... I shouldnt feel like I am trudging along all the code that I am writing... Its like they say "lets choose a common framework just cause if I don't know how to do something, I can just Google it. It is also comforting when something is mature enough that all of my present and future problems have been solved by others."

Sure that is ok but I know I am an engineer, not a boring developer... I don't think people understand it but there is a difference...
